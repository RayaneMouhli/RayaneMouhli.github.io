I am a PhD student in applied mathematics at MAP5 (Université Paris Cité) and LJLL (Sorbonne Université) under the supervision of [Barbara Gris](http://gris.perso.math.cnrs.fr/fr/) and [Irène Kaltenmark](https://sites.google.com/site/irenekaltenmark/). Previously, I was a visiting scholar at University of Utah where i worked with [Sarang Joshi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GyqdQTEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My main research interests span infinite dimensional geometry, Lie groups, and shape analysis. More specifically, I am currently working on decorrelation of vector fields and growth models. If you want to discuss, feel free to contact me !
