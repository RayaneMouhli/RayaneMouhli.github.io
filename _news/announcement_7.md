I gave a talk at  [Infinite-dimensional Geometry : Theory and Applications](https://www.esi.ac.at/events/e550/) workshop at Erwin Schrodinger Institute in Vienna (Austria) about "Decorrelation of vector fields with first variation of varifolds" ([slides](https://rayanemouhli.github.io/assets/pdf/Vienna_talk.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds8odUOmPWM)).
